# Week 1 - Activities

## Tuesday

#### 1. Watch this video about compilation and interpretation

#### 2. Search and answer the question: Java language is compiled or interpreted?

R/ Java is a particular language because it is compiled, but it is compiled into an intermediate language called bytecode, which is then interpreted.

#### 3. Create an algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currencty to USD

Definir "quetzal", "dolar", "cambio".

Cuantos quetzales quiere cambiar

"quetzal"

Ingrese el valor actual del dolar

"dolar"

"cambio" = "quetzal"*"dolar"

Usted tiene: "cambio" USD.

#### 4. Read about Pseudocode here, you can also find some examples here

#### 5. Anwser to the question: Why is pseudocode helpful?

R/Pseudocode helps us understand tasks in a language independent way.

#### 6. Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year they born, (you can define a variable with the actual year if you need it, like for example i could define Y <-- 2022)

#### 7. Read about flowcharts here

#### 8. Answer to the question: Why are flowcharts important to us as developers?

R/ It allows us to easily graphically see a certain logical process that can be useful for some type of task.

#### 9. Search about High-level languages and Low-level languages, you can start with this video

## Wednesday
#### 1. Learn about binary, decimal and hexadecimal numbers
Decimal system: It is a positional numbering system in which quantities are represented by the arithmetic base of the number ten. As the base is the number ten, we will have the ability to build all the figures using ten numbers that are what we all know. 0, 1,2 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. These numbers will be used to represent the position of the powers of 10 in the formation of any number.

#### 2. Translate the year you where born to binary, decimal and hexadecimal
#### 3. Translate 51966 into hexadecimal and binary
#### 4 Use a Low-level language, for example MIPS aseembler, to do so, you will need to follow this guide. We recomend to check the guide first but also this presentation could be helpful.
#### 5. Base on the examples and the guide of the low-level language: 5.1 Create a program to add two numbers given by the user 5.2 Create a program that display your name
